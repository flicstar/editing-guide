## Editing Philosophy 

### Authentic Communication 

We use a framework of Authentic Communication, employing empathy, clarity, and trust to create relevant content that is compelling to consume and technically accurate. 
This framework guides both our writing and editing processes.

**Empathy:** We recognize and respect the creative energy, effort, and time that an author or creator puts into their work. We want everyone—including ourselves—to grow as 
writers. Disproportionate critical feedback impedes or inhibits us from learning and growing as writers. For this reason, we put positive feedback first in our editorial 
review process. 

**Clarity:** Writers need to understand specifically how, why, and where their first draft is “good” (i.e. writing that connects the audience to the intended message in a 
compelling way). Seeing and explicitly highlighting examples of how they demonstrated excellent use of a writing principle highlights patterns writers can recognize, anchor, 
re-create, and refine. 

**Trust:** We build trust with each other when we recognize an author’s work. We use a system of [editing codes](editing-codes.md) which lets the author trust that the edits to their work are 
more objective (not perfectly, but more so than freestyle editing) and connected to a consistently applied set of principles and guidelines. 

### Communicate, Connect and Grow

Our editing philosophy does a few things.

:star: **Makes us better writers.** We learn from the edits made on our work. We can repeat the good, and improve the rest.

:star: **Makes us better editors.** Being transparent and sharing the reasoning behind changes we suggest, helps us be more systematic, methodical, and communicative.

:star: **Helps everyone communicate better.** Inspired by open source philosophy and practice, we share our methodology, tools, and processes with others.
