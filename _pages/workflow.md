title: "Editing Workflow"
---

Our editing workflow has six steps moving from the largest scope (structure) to the smallest (choice of words). These steps
give us a strong logical framework to help us be kind, consistent, and helpful editors.  

**Note:** Not all content requires exhaustive editing or review. Depending on your piece, you may spend more or less time on each step. Skip around as you see 
fit.

We use our [codes](codes.md) when editing.

### 1. Review the brief

With the brief in mind, read the written piece. Consult the brief to understand the goals for the writing—target audience for choice of language, 
research and interview material, conversion goals, etc.

### 2. Positivity pass (++)!

Provide ++ positive feedback first! Note the positive elements of the work. What are the overarching strengths, significant accomplishments, and powerful 
communication aspects of the work?

### 3. Review the narrative structure 

Consider the entirely of the written piece. Review the organizational structure of the writing, as well as the relevance 
and logical progression of the narrative. 

* Does the story told by the article remain within the planned scope outlined in the brief? 
* Does it include all the elements outlined in the brief? 
* Does the structure of the arguments support the narrative?
* Are the supporting points logical and valid? 
* Does the narrative open with a clear explanation of the topic and close with a call to action? 
* Look for needless repetition or extraneous sections that don’t add to the narrative.

### 4. Review and analyze flow and readability

Review each section in detail. Consider the beginning, middle, and end of each section. Assess how the content flows and segues between sections. Ensure 
there is a rhythm in the content to help the reader move through the narrative without fatigue. 

Clarify sections within the narrative and ensure the arrangement of the points contributes to the narrative. Look at the purpose of each section, each main argument, 
and how it is supported. Each paragraph should be unique and clear, and there should be a clear transition between each. 

Consider how to break up “walls of text” that impede the narrative and degrade readability. Also consider reader aids such as formatting, bullets, images, or diagrams 
to help explain concepts. 

### 5. Analyze style and phrasing

Assess the style and phrasing of the writing.

* Is the writing human-centric?
* Is the language appropriate for the target audience?
* Is the content engaging?  
    * Are there metaphors and analogies to add color and comprehensibility?
* Is the voice and tone appropriate to the brand and audience? 
* Is the writing “crisp” and to the point?
    * Remove the extraneous content that doesn’t add to the story.
    * Reduce complexity.
* Is the content inclusive and accessible? 
    * Address your audience directly where it makes sense: “You will learn,” rather than “people learn.”
    * Remove violent metaphors. 

### 6. Analyze and provide feedback on word choice

Look at the choice of specific words.  At this level, we can create stronger content with appropriate emotional tone and meaning 
by choosing words that are correct within the context of the content. We can also discard passive phrasing in favor of writing that exhibits more color and flair. This 
is where we focus on the accuracy of terminology, defining new phrases and terms for the audience. And of course, the right punctuation and grammar are essential for 
comprehension.
